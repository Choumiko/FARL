- Customizable placement of poles, multiple parallel tracks, lamps, turrets etc. with blueprints
- Bulldozer mode: removes rails,signals, poles, lamps, walls behind the train
- Maintenance mode: removes rails,signals, poles, lamps, walls in front of the train, places new layout
- Removes trees and stone rocks that are in the way (and adds 1 wood/tree, 15 stone/rock to cargo)
- Place rails on water if the train has concrete loaded
- Connects poles with red/green wires
- Cruise control: keeps the speed at ~87km/h (full speed when not placing rails) without pressing W, deactivate by pressing S
- For modders: Support for modded "compound" entities (Modders take a look at Mod support below)
- Support for modded rails, changeable via the settings

### Console commands

- You have to be in a FARL for them to work
- /farl_read_bp /farl_clear_bp /farl_vertical_bp /farl_diagonal_bp

Modded rails should work out of the box, as soon as updating FARL to at least 1.0.6
